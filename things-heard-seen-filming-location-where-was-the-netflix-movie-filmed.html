Details of Saginaw college, Red Hook, Willems, and Chosen.</span></span></p><p><span>Things Heard & Seen</span> was shot at numerous filming locations in the Hudson Valley. This supernatural thriller takes place in 1980 in the fictional place called Chosen, New York. <span>Larry Smith</span>‘s camerawork is as stunning as the artwork depicted in the film.</p><p>The plot, which is rich in symbolism, extends past a portrait of a troubled couple. Dark mysteries, mystical artworks, and a paranormal presence are all apparent in the film.</p><p>The movie begins with<span>&nbsp;Catherine Clare</span> (<span>Amanda Seyfried</span>) abandoning Manhattan for a peaceful life with her husband, <span>George</span> (<span>James Norton</span>), in a suburban farmhouse.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=things-heard-seen-filming-location-%e2%80%93-was-the-netflix-film-shot-in-hudson-valley-new-york></span>Things Heard & Seen Filming Location – Was the Netflix Film Shot in Hudson Valley, New York?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite the fact that movie theaters around the world have closed since 2020, new movies have made their way into Netflix with insane speed.</p><p><span>Things Heard & Seen</span>, Netflix’s latest horror feature, debuted on the streaming platform on 29th April, and it’s swiftly established in the movie that the incidents on our screens occur at Hudson Valley, New York.</p><p>But what is the precise filming location of <span>Things Heard & Seen</span>, and did the newest horror project of the streaming giants genuinely use any Hudson Valley sites?</p><p>The intriguing movie that hit the streaming platform on 29th April 2021 recounts the story of Catherine and George Claire, a married pair who move from Manhattan to a tiny town in the Hudson Valley as George kickstarts his new career.</p><p>The movie, based on the <span>Elizabeth Brundage</span> novel <span>All Things Cease to Appear </span>(2016), makes it&nbsp;obvious soon after the pair’s arrival that their relationship isn’t as healthy as they had hoped, and things get worse when their house’s dark and ghostly history is revealed.</p><p>Many who value realism would be happy to learn that <span>Things Heard & Seen</span> is shot in the same filming location as the movie claims. Having said this, although it was set in Hudson Valley, the area around Chosen and Saginaw College, where George begins his new career, are both made up.</p><p>According to <span>Lohud</span>, production on the project started in October 2019 and took place in more than 20 locations in the Hudson Valley.</p><p>The production staff set up filming location sites and used a recording studio at Tech City, on the previously IBM base, in the city of Kingston in Ulster County, New York.</p><p>The filming also happened in Red Hook, Rhinebeck, Millerton, Pine Plains, and Palenville, with famous sites such as Tivoli’s Red Church and Red Hood’s historic library making appearances.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The @redhooklibrary is one location to keep an eye out for when watching “Things Heard & Seen” on Netflix..

This is due to the fact that the venue is currently owned by a local resident who lent it out for shooting.</p><p>The team battled to find an appropriate ranch house to act as the central spot during the location exploration period.
