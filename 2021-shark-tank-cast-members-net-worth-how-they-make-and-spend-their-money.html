<time>14 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>ABC’s money-talking reality show Shark Tank has been on air for close to a decade now. It is a program where business owners showcase their business ideas before a panel of investors (known as ‘sharks’) who also serve as judges of the presentation. The aim is for the business owners to convince the judges to fund their ideas. Of course, this already implies that the judges are wealthy folks. Although they fund a lot of these ideas, these judges are also known for the stilted ways in which they often reject well-choreographed and competitively scrutinized proposals. Since this is a show that is centered around business and money, let’s talk about the net worth of the Shark Tank cast members.</p><p>Below is a list of the cast members, their net worths and how they achieved such financial values. The list comprises both the main cast members as well as the guest stars.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shark-tank-main-cast-members-and-their-net-worths></span><strong>Shark Tank Main Cast Members and Their Net Worths</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=barbara-ann-corcoran-%e2%80%93-80-million></span><strong>Barbara Ann Corcoran – $80 million</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The New Jersey native set out on her career journey via the real estate industry.
