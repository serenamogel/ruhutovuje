In a huge shock to everyone, Sridevi passed away few hours back in Dubai due to a massive heart attack. The world is still not able to cope with that news.&nbsp;<p>If you were growing up in 80s, there was no way you could be oblivious to her magic on screen. She singed the celluloid with her mere presence. Those impish eyes, those facial expressions, those dances are all memories now. She reigned the silver screen like no one else. With a string on successes, she was the first female superstar of Bollywood. Films were made with her in mind. A talent so terrific that no one could match up to her in ages.&nbsp;</p><p>We at Filmfare remember the Icon by listing her best Hindi films to date.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sadma (1983)</strong></p><p>Her Hindi career didn’t quite take off as Solva Sawan failed to impress the ticket buyers. But with the coming of Mondram Pirai in Tamil and Kamal Haasan’s growing popularity in the Hindi markets, the film was Sadma in Hindi and it catapulted Sridevi in to a list of promising young actors. Playing a child-like adult in a complicated and tragic love story, Sridevi exhibited the same charm and skill that got her noticed in her Hindi debut.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/filmfare.wwmindia.com/content/2018/feb/1_1519538453.jpg alt="Top Hindi Films" width=615 height=415 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><strong>Himmatwala (1983)</strong><p>A corollary to Sri’s success in Sadma was her first major film with Jeetendra. Himmatwala was a remake of the Telugu hit Ooriki Monagadu (1981) and Sri’s role was really to fit into the commercial mould of a Hindi film heroine. Not only did the film’s blockbuster success kick off the Jeetendra-Sridevi partnership, it established Sri as one of the best dancing actors in the country.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/filmfare.wwmindia.com/content/2018/feb/2_1519538468.jpg alt="Top Hindi Films" width=615 height=615 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><strong>Inquilaab (1984)</strong><p>Inquilaab was Sridevi’s first film opposite superstar Amitabh Bachchan. Being Amitabh’s leading lady was a casting success for any actress. In the film she played the daughter of a rich politician who falls in love with an idealistic super cop. But as he husband succeeds in his career, she begins to find out that he’s a pawn in the hands of her father. The progressive themes of the film ensured Sri had a challenging role as Amitabh went about his regular angry young man fare.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/filmfare.wwmindia.com/content/2018/feb/3_1519538490.jpg alt="Top Hindi Films" width=615 height=746 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><strong>Tohfa (1984)</strong><p>While press columns were full of the rivalry between Sri and Jayapradha, Tohfa released to great fanfare at the theatres. This classic love triangle gave Jayapradha a meatier role but Sri’s lavish dances with Jeetendra made the film a runaway hit. To date, the song Tohfa tohfa… laya laya is remembered with great enthusiasm.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/filmfare.wwmindia.com/content/2018/feb/4_1519538512.jpg alt="Top Hindi Films" width=615 height=785 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><strong>Nagina (1985)</strong><p>Sridevi played a young and enigmatic Rajni who’s accused of being a shape shifting serpent by the villainous Amrish Puri. Sri’s love story with Rishi Kapoor in the film was cute but what stole the show was her nagin act. The song Main teri dushman with Amrish Puri as the dastardly snake charmer is now stuff of movie legends.</p><p><strong>Aakhree Raasta (1986)</strong></p><p>Yes this was another film cashing in on the Sridevi-Jayaprada rivalry. It was a film where Amitabh Bachchan and his double role were more important. It was one of the many Hindi films where Sridevi’s voice was dubbed by Rekha. But in spite of so many detracting facts, Sri still managed to leave an impact. She balance marvelously well between comedy, romance and drama, a trait which would from then on, become a mainstay of her commercial performances.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/filmfare.wwmindia.com/content/2018/feb/5_1519538529.jpg alt="Top Hindi Films" width=615 height=824 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><strong>Karma (1986)</strong><p>This multi-starrer was perhaps Sridevi’s most important big ticket film at the time. A movie with Dilip Kumar, Naseeruddin Shah, Jackie Shroff, Anil Kapoor and Nutan with Subhash Ghai at the helm was a casting feat and dream come true for a young actress. Well, in her brief and insignificant role as Radha she shared some fantastic chemistry with Jackie Shroff and together they added some young charm to the film.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/filmfare.wwmindia.com/content/2018/feb/6_1519538554.jpg alt="Top Hindi Films" width=615 height=599 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><strong>Mr India (1987)</strong><p>It was the humongous popularity of Mr India that made Sri into a female superstar. This was Anil Kapoor’s film all the way but trust Sri to come up with moments of brilliance and steal the show. Her bubbly portrayal of Seema, her unforgettable performance in Hawa hawaii and her untamed sensuousness in Kaante nahi kat the have made Mr India one of Hindi cinema’s best film ever..</p><p><strong>Nigahen: Nagina Part II (1989)</strong></p><p>With the release of Nigahen, the sequel to the popular Nagina, Sridevi became one of the rare Hindi actors to have her own movie franchise. It never progressed beyond the second film, but it was a rare feat to even have a sequel. So Sri returned as the icchadhari nagin (shape shifting serpent) and etched that legend forever in Hindi movie lore. Her romance with shape shifting counterpart Sunny Deol made for some thrills and spills in this potboiler thriller.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/filmfare.wwmindia.com/content/2018/feb/7_1519538591.jpg alt="Top Hindi Films" width=615 height=623 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><strong>Chandni (1989)</strong><p>The film’s music made platinum success and rare feat for movies of the late eighties. The film breathed new life into the careers of Rishi Kapoor and director Yash Chopra. But more than anything else, the film established Sridevi as the actress to beat. Her white costumes revolutionized fashion and everyone wanted the Chandni look.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/filmfare.wwmindia.com/content/2018/feb/8_1519538607.jpg alt="Top Hindi Films" width=615 height=354 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><strong>ChaalBaaz (1989)</strong><p>She played twins the tamed and submissive Anju and the boisterous and go-getting Manju. Manju helps Anju turn the tables on Anupam Kher and Rohini Hattangdi’s scheming characters. Success came in the form of box office returns and her first Hindi Filmfare Award for Best Actress.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/filmfare.wwmindia.com/content/2018/feb/9_1519538623.jpg alt="Top Hindi Films" width=615 height=615 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><strong>Lamhe (1991)</strong><p>In Lamhe she played another double role but it was unlike any played before. The film’s progressive themes of love and irony gave Sri ample room to display her acting chops. The film didn’t emulate Chandni’s success but Sri managed to prove that she was an actor to reckon with as she won the Filmfare Best Actor (Female) Award.</p><p><strong>Gumrah (1993)</strong></p><p>Sri displayed characteristic intensity while playing the wronged and vengeful Roshni in Gumrah. There were some nice songs and dances in the film too. But in spite of Sri and Sanjay Dutt’s performances, the film failed to please the audience.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/filmfare.wwmindia.com/content/2018/feb/10_1519538652.jpg alt="Top Hindi Films" width=615 height=615 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><strong>Khuda Gawah (1993)</strong><p>The film was talked-about because Bachchan had given a string of flops and was banking on Sri's partnership to provide him with a much needed hit. It's said he sent a truck full of roses to make her say yes to the project. Her performance matched Amitabh’s larger-than-life character and the film has gained a cult following over the years</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/filmfare.wwmindia.com/content/2018/feb/11_1519538665.jpg alt="Top Hindi Films" width=615 height=848 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><strong>Laadla (1994)</strong><p>She took over the film when Divya Bharti passed away and made the film her own. The first half showed her to be hellbent on teaching Anil Kapoor's character a lesson but mellowed down in the latter half and showcased another side to the role effectively.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/filmfare.wwmindia.com/content/2018/feb/12_1519538677.jpg alt="Top Hindi Films" width=615 height=346 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><strong>Judaai (1997)</strong></p><p>The story was unique and so was Sri’s character that lets her husband marry another woman for a large sum of money. Even after 18 years, Sri brought her characteristic energy to moment of comedy and high drama and made Judaai her last memorable performance.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/filmfare.wwmindia.com/content/2018/feb/13_1519538692.jpg alt="Top Hindi Films" width=615 height=791 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><strong>English Vinglish (2012)</strong><p>She made a comeback of sorts with this delightful film about an Indian expat who overcomes her inherent shyness and lives a more fulfilling life after joining an English class. The transformation from a submissive housewife to a more assertive figure looked natural and was all done with great verve and grace.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/filmfare.wwmindia.com/content/2018/feb/14_1519538703.jpg alt="Top Hindi Films" width=615 height=891 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><strong>Mom (2017)</strong><p>Sridevi was at her angriest in Mom, tracking down her daughters rapists and exacting revenge one after the other. She looked like an avenging angel in the film but there was a softer side to her as well, which too was deftly brought out.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/filmfare.wwmindia.com/content/2018/feb/15_1519538725.jpg alt="Top Hindi Films" width=615 height=921 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> More on: <a href=#><span>Sridevi</span></a> <a style=text-decoration:none class="row drops" onclick='showCommentBox("1",26781)' href=#><h2 class="commentsCount clearfix"><span>SHOW COMMENTS</span></h2><span id=commentCount26781 class="expand-i pull-right"></span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XLpp2aqpVjsLC5jqecsKtfl7ytuNiwpqicX6i%2FqrDEr6CsZZKawLV5xaKjpqtdnrturs6lo7Kvn6Sxbn6VcG9qZpipuq0%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsridevis-best-films-in-bollywood-26781-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsridevis-best-films-in-bollywood-26781-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsridevis-best-films-in-bollywood-26781-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsridevis-best-films-in-bollywood-26781-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsridevis-best-films-in-bollywood-26781-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsridevis-best-films-in-bollywood-26781-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./steve-howey-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./steve-howey-2.html>Steve Howey Age, Net Worth, Wife, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kenneth-collard-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Kenneth Collard Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kenneth-collard-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
