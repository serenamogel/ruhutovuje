She starred on the British stage until the mid-1990s, when she appeared in her first film, Heavenly Creatures. In 1997 she had the lead role in Titanic, which propelled her to international stardom. She has since starred in several films and won the best actress Oscar for The Reader. She has also received several Golden Globes, including wins for Revolutionary Road, Mildred Pierce and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/business-leaders/steve-jobs data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Steve Jobs" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Steve Jobs</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born on October 5, 1975, in Reading, England, Kate Elizabeth Winslet is the granddaughter of two theater managers (her maternal grandparents founded Reading Repertory Theatre) and the daughter of two actors. Winslet began acting as a child, making her first appearance on British television at age 7 in a cereal commercial. In 1988, she appeared on the TV series Shrinks; three years later, she left school to pursue her fledgling acting career.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Winslet appeared on the British stage in productions such as Adrian Mole and Peter Pan, and had a recurring role on the British sitcom Get Back, before landing her debut film role in Heavenly Creatures (1994), directed by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/peter-jackson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Peter Jackson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Peter Jackson</a>. In the film, Winslet played Juliet Hulme, a schoolgirl with tuberculosis whose obsessive friendship with a classmate leads the two girls to murder the classmate's mother in order to avoid separation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Winslet attracted even more attention with her next role in Ang Lee's film adaptation of the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/jane-austen data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jane Austen" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jane Austen</a> novel Sense and Sensibility (1995). The actress proved she could hold her own across from screen legends such as Emma Thompson, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/hugh-grant data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hugh Grant" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Hugh Grant</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/alan-rickman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alan Rickman" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Alan Rickman</a>. As the winsome Marianne Dashwood—the "sensibility" of the movie—Winslet earned an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress. The film also earned high praise from critics.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Oscar Nomination for 'Titanic'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In a similarly high-brow role, Winslet starred with Christopher Eccleston in Jude, a modern interpretation of the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.biography.com/people/thomas-hardy-9328464 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Thomas Hardy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Thomas Hardy</a> novel Jude the Obscure. She then appeared as Ophelia in Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet (1996), and landed squarely on the A-list of leading ladies with her performance as Rose DeWitt, the heroine of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/james-cameron data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="James Cameron" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">James Cameron</a>'s record-breaking blockbuster Titanic (1997). The film won numerous Academy Awards, including best picture and best director, and scored Winslet her second Academy Award nomination, this time for best actress. Her co-star, Gloria Stuart, also earned a nod in the supporting actress category for her portrayal of the older Rose DeWitt; the two actresses became the first ever to earn nominations for playing two versions of the same character.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On the heels of her first blockbuster hit, Winslet made two somewhat unlikely choices for her next projects: Hideous Kinky (1999) and Holy Smoke (1999). In Hideous Kinky, Winslet played a free-spirited single mother who brings her two daughters on a spiritual quest to Marrakech. For the Jane Campion-directed Holy Smoke, Winslet played Ruth Barron, a young woman who joins a religious cult. The film's frank depiction of the sexual connection between Barron and PJ Waters (played by Harvey Keitel) displayed Winslet's talent for portraying physical and emotional nudity onscreen.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Winslet then returned to a period drama in 2000 with the film Quills, a movie about the French novelist<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/marquis-de-sade data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" Marquis de Sade" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> Marquis de Sade</a>. In the movie, Winslet portrayed the laundress who helps the Marquis (Geoffrey Rush) smuggle his illicit writings out of an insane asylum during his commitment there.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">More Accolades and Oscar Win</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2001, Winslet lent her voice to the animated British feature A Christmas Carol. A song from the movie, "What If," featured Winslet as the lead vocalist and became a Top 10 single in Britain. Her most notable film that year was Iris, a screenplay based on the John Bailey book Elegy for Iris. Winslet played the young Iris Murdoch, an unconventional student. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/judi-dench data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Judi Dench" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Judi Dench</a> played the older Iris, whose husband (Jim Broadbent) tries to help her as she struggles with the growing effects of her Alzheimer's disease. All three Iris stars earned Academy Award nominations, making it the second time Winslet and a co-star both earned nominations for playing different versions of the same character.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That same year, Winslet co-starred as a code-breaker in the World War II-era spy drama Enigma (2002). She also appeared as a reporter interviewing a death-row inmate in The Life of David Gale, co-starring <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/kevin-spacey data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kevin Spacey" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kevin Spacey</a> and Laura Linney. In 2004, Winslet starred opposite <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/jim-carrey data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jim Carrey" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jim Carrey</a> in Charlie Kaufman's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which earned her another Academy Award nomination for her performance. She also co-starred with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/johnny-depp data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Johnny Depp" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Johnny Depp</a> in Finding Neverland (2004), which explored <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/jm-barrie data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="J.M. Barrie" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">J.M. Barrie</a>'s inspiration for his best-known work, Peter Pan. In the film, Winslet played the widowed mother of four boys whom Barrie befriended.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Again playing a maternal role, Winslet starred in Little Children (2006) as a frustrated suburban woman who gets involved with a married man. She earned yet another Academy Award nomination for this film. Continuing to tackle serious dramas, Winslet starred in Revolutionary Road (2008) and The Reader (2008). For Revolutionary Road, Winslet teamed up again with her Titanic co-star <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/leonardo-dicaprio data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Leonardo DiCaprio" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> as a struggling married couple in the 1950s. The Reader explores the relationship between a young boy and an older woman (Winslet), and their later encounter when she is put on trial for war crimes. The performance finally netted the acclaimed actress her first Academy Award win.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Winslet later won a Golden Globe and an Emmy Award for her starring role in the miniseries Mildred Pierce (2011). The part had been previously played by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/joan-crawford data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Joan Crawford" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Joan Crawford</a> in the 1945 feature film version of the James M. Cain novel. Winslet also starred in the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/roman-polanski data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Roman Polanski" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Roman Polanski</a> film Carnage with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/jodie-foster data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jodie Foster" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jodie Foster</a>, Christoph Waltz and John C.

In 2015 she also starred as Apple executive Joanna Hoffman in the biopic Steve Jobs, receiving another Golden Globe for her efforts as well as the seventh Oscar nomination of her career.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After starring in the Australian production The Dressmaker (2015), Winslet joined the ensemble casts of Triple 9 (2016) and Collateral Beauty (2016). She returned with two projects in late 2017: The Mountain Between Us, an adventure-survival film with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/idris-elba data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Idris Elba" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Idris Elba</a>, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/woody-allen data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Woody Allen" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Woody Allen</a>'s Wonder Wheel.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Later that year, it was also announced that Titantic fans would get another chance to watch the romance between Winslet's Rose and DiCaprio's Jack play out on the big screen. Tickets went on sale November 15 for a limited run of a re-mastered version of Titanic, scheduled to play in 87 theaters equipped with Dolby Cinema beginning December 1.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Winslet is married to Ned Rocknroll, nephew of business mogul <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/business-leaders/richard-branson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Richard Branson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Richard Branson</a>.

Winslet and Mendes have one child together, a son named Joe. She also has a daughter, Mia, from her first marriage to Jim Threapleton.
