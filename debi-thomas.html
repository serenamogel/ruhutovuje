She became the first African American to win a non-novice title at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, and in 1988 she was the first Black athlete to earn a medal at the Winter Olympics. Thomas graduated from Stanford University and became an orthopedic surgeon, before her struggles with her post-skating life were revealed in 2015.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born Debra Janine Thomas on March 25, 1967, in Poughkeepsie, New York, Debi Thomas is best known for becoming the first African American win a medal at the Winter Olympic Games in 1988. Thomas first stepped into the skating rink at the age of five. By age nine, she was taking formal lessons and winning competitions. At 10, Thomas signed on with coach Alex McGowan, who guided her career as she trained for the Olympics.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As an African American figure skater, judges often discriminated against Thomas, giving better marks to her competitors for what many saw as less-impressive skills. She persevered, however, and at the age of 12, she advanced to the national novice finals, where she won the silver medal.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Leading American Skater</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Thomas pursued higher education while continuing to skate competitively. As a freshman at Stanford University, where she studied engineering, Thomas scored two major career victories. In February 1986, she took the senior women's title at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships â€” becoming the first African American to win a non-novice title. That same year, Thomas earned the top spot at the World Championships.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1988, Thomas competed at the Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada. She won the bronze medal in the women's figure skating event (finishing behind Canada's Elizabeth Manley and East Germany's Katarina Witt), thereby becoming the first African American to win a medal in any sport at the Winter Olympics. That same year, Thomas once again won the U.S. Championships.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Life After Olympics</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1991, Thomas earned her bachelor's degree from Stanford University. She retired from skating the following year in order to enter Northwestern University Medical School. After graduating from Northwestern in 1997, Thomas decided to continue her medical training to become an orthopedic surgeon.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After completing her residency at Charles R. Drew University in Los Angeles, California, she received a fellowship at Centinela Hospital's Dorr Arthritis Institute in Inglewood. In 2010, Thomas opened her own practice in Virginia, specializing in knee and hip replacements.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Over the years, Thomas has received many accolades for her contributions to figure skating. She was inducted into the U.S. Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 2000, and served as a representative for the U.S. Olympic Committee at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. Additionally, Thomas became an active supporter of several charities, including the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the Ara Parseghian Medical Research Foundation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Thomas dropped out of the spotlight for many years, and when she resurfaced in late 2015, fans were surprised to learn how her life had taken a turn for the worse. Thomas had been forced to close her practice, and with her savings gone and custody of her teenage son relinquished following two divorces, she revealed she was living in a bedbug-infested trailer with her fiancee and his two sons. The news came to light after the once-celebrated athlete reached out to motivational coach Iyanla Vanzant, the star of the reality show Iyanla: Fix My Life, with the hope of turning things around.</p><ul data-node-id=25 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Debi</li><li>Birth Year: 1967</li><li>Birth date: March 25, 1967</li><li>Birth State: New York</li><li>Birth City: Poughkeepsie</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Debi Thomas was the first African American to win the women's title at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships and a medal in Winter Olympics competition.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Sports</li><li>Science and Medicine</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Aries</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Northwestern University Medical School</li><li>Stanford University</li></ul><li>Interesting Facts</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>In 1986, Debi Thomas became the first African American to win the women's title at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships.</li><li>In 1988, Debi Thomas became the first black Olympian to win a medal at the Winter Olympics.</li></ul></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/page/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=29><ul data-node-id=31 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Debi Thomas Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/athlete/debi-thomas</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: May 17, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=35 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Figure skating was a pretty individual sport.
