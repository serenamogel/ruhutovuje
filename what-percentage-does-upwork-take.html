The 3% fee is assessed any time we charge your billing method.<h2>Does Upwork charge a monthly fee?</h2>How much does Upwork Plus cost?

This is another reason why it's worth eventually “graduating” to clients off-platform — you can kick out the middle man and charge more.<h2>How much does Upwork take from client?</h2>Every time you begin a relationship with a new client, you'll be charged an Upwork fee of 20%. This percentage is taken from the amount that the client pays you.<h2>Does Upwork charge the employer?</h2>Both Upwork and Guru connect employers with talented freelancers.

The biggest one is that Upwork takes 20% of a freelancer's pay up until they reach $500 with a client. That means that if you aren't having repeat clients and working with the same people, you're always going to hand over that 20% to Upwork.<h2>Is Upwork still worth it in 2022?</h2>In a word: Yes. After a thorough review of Upwork, we've found that it does have a few unique benefits compared to similar platforms. Their billing and hour track systems are well-organized and easy to use.
