It is necessary to acknowledge people irrespective of their age through various forms of greeting – whether through a friendly wave, a nod, a smile, or a hello. It is not a big deal if you say Hello to a younger person; in African culture, the younger ones are expected to greet elderly people first as a sign of respect.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/hello3-e1638397224226.jpg><p>The South African culture promotes respect among its citizens. Whether you find yourself in an informal or formal environment, you should at least say Hello to anyone you may wish to speak with. When you enter a cab and meet someone, say Hello. When you want to ask for direction or make an inquiry from someone, say Hello or any form of greeting to the person.</p><p>Saying Hello to people of younger age, opposite gender, and lower class doesn’t make you less of who you are. While it is not compulsory to exchange pleasantries with people, it is necessary you do so at all times. And mind you, not everyone will respond to your greeting. That shouldn’t make you feel sad or disappointed. Just keep doing it.</p><h3><strong>How To Say Hello In IsiZulu</strong></h3><p>There are over 12 million native speakers of IsiZulu.
