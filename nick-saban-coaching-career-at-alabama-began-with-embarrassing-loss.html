In fact, the coach’s first season in Tuscaloosa was quite inauspicious, with one “catastrophic” loss in particular cited as a catalyst for Saban’s run of dominance with the Tide.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Alabama was fledgling when Saban took over</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Alabama was decades removed from the reign of legendary coach <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athlete/bear-bryant data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bear Bryant" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bear Bryant</a>—himself a six-time champion at the school during the 1960s and ’70s—when it lured Saban away from the NFL’s Miami Dolphins in 2007.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In four previous seasons under Mike Shula, the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/alabama/index.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tide were a pedestrian 27-24 overall" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Tide were a pedestrian 27-24 overall</a> with a win in the 2006 Cotton Bowl Classic as the highlight. The team didn’t even have bragging rights in its own state, as rival Auburn had won their head-to-head matchup in the Iron Bowl five years running.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Headlines off the field weren’t any better, even in the early days of Saban’s tenure. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://vault.si.com/vault/2007/08/27/in-the-nick-of-time data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to Sports Illustrated" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">According to Sports Illustrated</a>, three Alabama reserve players were charged by police in a July 2007 incident.

But after player suspensions affected the team’s lineup, “the wheels kind of came off,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.sbnation.com/a/2007-college-football-season/alabama-ulm-nick-saban data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="then-freshman quarterback Greg McElroy said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">then-freshman quarterback Greg McElroy said</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Alabama was 6-4 and on a two-game losing streak going into a home game against lowly Louisiana-Monroe, a 25-point underdog. But instead of gaining momentum against an opponent considered vastly inferior, the Tide played abysmally and committed four turnovers in a 21-14 loss.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As if the score wasn’t enough of an attention-grabber, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=3120600" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Saban associated the game" data-vars-ga-product-id=be610f8f-d3e1-4733-9e14-075ee1049db9 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=3120600" data-product-url="https://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=3120600" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1712615&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Fcollege-football%2Fnews%2Fstory%3Fid%3D3120600" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=47702f7c-abd3-4d93-89ed-e8b058bbf93b class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">Saban associated the game</a> with a pair of American tragedies in a now-infamous news conference. “Changes in history usually occur after some kind of catastrophic event,” Saban said. “It may be 9/11, which sort of changed the spirit of America relative to catastrophic events. Pearl Harbor kind of got us ready for World War II, and that was a catastrophic event.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“They talk about alcoholics and people like that who never ever change until they hit rock bottom,” Saban continued. “Well, they change because when they hit rock bottom they have an awareness, they have an acceptance and a commitment to change. That’s what our players need to do right now.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His eye-catching descriptions caused controversy given the colossal death tolls of the tragedies. More than 2,400 military members and civilians died at Pearl Harbor in December 1941, and 9/11 is the worst act of terrorism in the United States. The 2001 attack killed nearly 3,000 people.
