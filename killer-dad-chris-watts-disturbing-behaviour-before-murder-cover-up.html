"I don't know where my head is at," he told her.</p><p>He would not have sex with her, and when she took his hand during an ultrasound, he didn't hold it back.

By the time the 33-year-old joined his family in North Carolina after five weeks, he was cold and distant.</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-world">Related articles</h2><p>The pair fought and Shanann confided in friends that Watts would not touch or hold her.

But on the Saturday night, she noticed a credit card bill for $60 from a restaurant.</p><p>She contacted Watts to ask what he was doing, her colleagues told police, and he told her he had bought salmon and a beer while out to see a game with friends. The doubtful group of friends looked up the price of that meal at the restaurant in question — it was a third of what he had paid.</p><p>He was out with his mistress, while a babysitter cared for the children.</p><p>The following night, Nichol spoke to Watts between 9pm and 11pm, and was surprised to hear he was watching television — "odd behaviour for him" because of his 6am start at work. They regularly spoke while he stayed in the basement of the family home, but she recalled wondering if he was waiting up for his wife.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/SNMx33obKfXO8e1-cLK39in6kkc=/16x13/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/VAEUF7XKBJJBACBSTCMKB7FXKY.jpg"><p>Shanann was dropped off at home by her friend Nickole Atkinson just before 2am on Monday, August 13, and it's at this point that there's a gap in the timeline.</p><p>Footage from 5.30am shows Watts backing his work truck up to the garage before driving off, something the family's friends agreed was unusual.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/Jf1ImHCCdcHTmv3JkJcpy2ZfhtQ=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/XLRLC57MUSG4IGZ53LYZVW2OS4.jpg"><p>Police believe that at some point during this window he viciously killed his wife and children, before driving the bodies to the site of the oil and gas company where he worked.</p><h2 class=article__heading>'HE DID NOT SEEM OVERLY CONCERNED'</h2><p>A fellow Anadarko Petroleum employee said she saw Watts digging a hole near an oil drum at the work site.</p><p>Nickole, the colleague who had dropped Shanann at home from the airport, knew her pregnant friend had been feeling ill and was concerned when she failed to answer messages and missed a doctor's appointment.</p><p>Nicki went to the house, and when she found it empty, she called Watts.

He did not ask any questions or offer to help and his facial expressions rarely changed, except to inappropriately smile or smirk.</p><p>Watts said he and Shanann had had an "emotional" but civil conversation when he woke her around 5am, with talk of separating. She had said she was going to stay with a friend before he left.</p><p>But officers noticed Shanann's bag, wallet, medication, mobile phone, driver's licence and even her wedding ring were still in the house.

He was lying on a mattress with no sheets and told her he was cleaning the house for something to do, she said.</p><p>He said he had been sleeping, which she thought was bizarre when his family was missing. When she asked Watts about early newspaper reports his wife was pregnant, he said Shanann had only told him that on Monday morning after he woke her.

She also looked up how much money Frey made in her book deal and her net worth.</p><p>"He lied about everything," she told the Denver Post. "It got to a point that he was telling me so many lies that I eventually told him that I did not want to speak to him again until his family was found."</p><p>They never were. Within days, police spotted a fitted sheeted much like the one missing from the family home in a field south of the petroleum company's site.</p><p>On August 15, two days after the family's disappearance, Watts was arrested on suspicion of triple murder and first-degree unlawful termination of a pregnancy.
