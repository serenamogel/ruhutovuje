She also mentions how she feels terrible when she wakes up in the middle of the night, and Mark is still not in bed. She does, however, believe they are extremely lucky. Her family is engaged in a massive charitable effort known as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.</p><p>The couple does not offer kids everything materially even if they could do so immediately. Mark explains that they have been assigned responsibilities. This is a photo of them working in the kitchen, and this is how parenting should be. The parents also take their children to work so that they may observe how their parents operate.&nbsp;Date Night is a custom established by her parents, and no one is permitted to discuss work on date night.&nbsp;Mark confesses that he is the sentimental one in the relationship. They had no idea Facebook would grow to be so large. Her father acknowledges that her mother’s influence on him has a lot to do with Facebook’s success.</p><h2>I’ll look after you.</h2><p>Mark and Priscilla are very fortunate to have such wonderful children who brighten their lives.&nbsp;Here’s a lovely image in which Maxima seems to be telling her smaller sister, “I’ll look after you.”&nbsp;Her mother is holding her sister August Chan Zuckerberg, who is stroking her feet, and her father, Mark, is smiling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Maxima-Chan-Zuckerberg-1.jpg><h2>Her Family</h2><p>Maxima is the first child of Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan.

Maxima is seen with her parents and younger sister. It’s a candid picture taken at their house on the occasion of Chinese New Year.</p><h2>Her Parents’ Love Story</h2><p>Maxima’s parents, Mark and Priscilla, met for the first time in an unusual setting.&nbsp;It happened in the restroom line during a fraternity party at Harvard University in 2003.&nbsp;Mark’s first words to Priscilla were,&nbsp;“I’m going to be thrown out in three days, so we need to go on a date right away.”&nbsp;She thought he was an interesting person who wasn’t that studios. She fell in love with him the moment she met him.</p><p>On their first date, he informed Priscilla that he would rather go on a date with her than complete his take-home midterm, and he did.&nbsp;After two years, in 2005, he dropped out of university to concentrate on Facebook.&nbsp;He relocated to California and established his Facebook office. Priscilla was constantly at his side, through all of his ups and downs.&nbsp;She was the first person to join Facebook, on February 5, 2004.</p><p>She even relocated to California after graduating from Harvard University to continue her education. Because Mark was previously extremely busy with his job, Priscilla established a few ground rules for him to observe for the sake of their relationship. They said that she needed date and 100 minutes of alone time each week and that she should not be on Facebook. Mark was totally over heels in love with her, therefore no matter how busy he was, he made time for her.

When everyone arrived at their home, the couple revealed their engagement.</p><h2>Her Father’s Relationship</h2><p>Maxima has a great relationship with her father. Mark thought she inherited his characteristics since she gave him a thumbs up during their ultrasound.&nbsp;He even took two months of paternity leave to spend time with their new kid.&nbsp;He makes himself accessible to her anytime she needs him and never misses an opportunity to write about her little accomplishments.&nbsp;Mark even uploaded a photo with a message.&nbsp;‘Today is the first day of…</p><h2>Maxima Chan Zuckerberg Adorable Moments with Father and Mother</h2><p>Maxima Chan Zuckerberg’s Adorable Moments With Her Father And Mother Instagram is the source of this information.<br>The connection between the father and daughter is shown in the film.
