It became the first rap single to go No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and turned Vanilla Ice into a pop sensation who brought hip-hop from the streets to the suburbs.</p><p>“Ice Ice Baby” even landed the artist, born Robert Van Winkle, a movie-star vehicle — remember “Cool As Ice”? And the song — which debuted Aug. 22, 1990 — is the main reason there is a biopic, “To the Extreme,” being made about Vanilla Ice, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dave Franco starring as the rapper</a>.</p><p>But there was a lot of drama behind “Ice Ice Baby” before it rode that bass line all the way to the top of the pop charts.</p><p>It all started when Brown was DJing at a Dallas club called City Lights, where Vanilla Ice — who then was known as just Ice — would enter dance contests. Tommy Quon — the club owner and Vanilla Ice’s future manager — saw a budding star, and the search was on to find some material for him.</p><p>“The first song that I did for Ice was ‘Play That Funky Music,’” Brown says. “I just took that [Wild Cherry sample] and then I put a black beat behind it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/vanilla-ice-2.jpg><p>The most divine inspiration, however, came from sampling “Under Pressure” on “Ice Ice Baby.” But tensions between Brown and Vanilla Ice almost killed the magic before it had a chance to happen.</p><p>“I was adding some more elements to it,” he says. “Ice comes into the studio, and he asked me to make a cassette tape of just the beat so he could ride around and listen to it. He claimed he wanted to ride around and write to it. But I wasn’t agreeing with that type of situation because when I’m working on something, I like to have finished product before I let anybody hear it … There were words exchanged between me and Ice, and I told Tommy that I wanted all my tracks erased.”</p><p>Quon kept the tracks anyway, though, and one day Brown heard another DJ playing the beat of “Ice Ice Baby” at a club. “And then,” Brown says, “all of a sudden I heard it on the radio, with lyrics on it. I said, ‘That’s my song!’”</p><p>Eventually, Brown worked out a production deal with Quon, mended fences with Vanilla Ice and became his road DJ on tour with the likes of MC Hammer. Although “Ice Ice Baby” was originally the B-side to “Play That Funky Music,” it took on a life of its own.</p><p>As the song took off, though, problems arose because they didn’t clear the “Under Pressure” sample at first. They had to settle a deal on the publishing with Queen and David Bowie, who are all credited as co-writers of the song.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/vanilla-ice.jpg><p>Then there were questions about who actually wrote the lyrics. Turns out it was Brown’s former collaborator, Mario “Chocolate” Johnson. “I remembered that every time I would do the music, Ice would leave and come back with some lyrics,” Brown says. “Now I’ve never actually seen Ice write lyrics … The lyrics sounded familiar, but I couldn’t pinpoint who it was.”</p><p>Despite the controversy and other bumps along the way, the “Ice Ice Baby” explosion was a memorable time for Brown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/vanilla-ice-dj-earthquake.jpg><p>“The experience of that was pretty amazing,” he says. “We didn’t believe that it could actually go that far [to No. 1]. I’m such a humble person, I was just working. My royalty checks were coming home, but … I didn’t know that I had hundreds of thousands of dollars sitting back at home in the mailbox.”</p><p>To this day, Brown remains friends with Vanilla Ice. “We talk to each other probably every other day,” he says. “He also wants to create another album. I’ve got songs right now for Ice.”</p><p>Certainly, they are forever bonded by “Ice Ice Baby.” Says Brown: “It was blood, sweat and tears to get to where we went.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3F7j3Fma2hfqbWmecKhoKWkmaO0brDRmqSaZZKataq6w2agnJ1dnrCmecGambJlY2V6urHAq6pmmZapsrN5yK2qZqqVobKiv8Ro</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-chilling-drama-behind-ice-ice-baby-30-years-after-its-release.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-chilling-drama-behind-ice-ice-baby-30-years-after-its-release.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-chilling-drama-behind-ice-ice-baby-30-years-after-its-release.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-chilling-drama-behind-ice-ice-baby-30-years-after-its-release.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-chilling-drama-behind-ice-ice-baby-30-years-after-its-release.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-chilling-drama-behind-ice-ice-baby-30-years-after-its-release.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./zach-shallcross-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./zach-shallcross-net-worth-2024.html>Zach Shallcross Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./pok-c3-a9mon-showcase.html>Pokmon Showcase - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./pok-c3-a9mon-showcase.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
